# Overview

Abacaxi is a web application designed to make it easier for interested parties to learn about topics in video format. It pulls page structuring from the respective Wikipedia page and structures it with our own style. Under each heading, however, resides a video pertaining to the specific subtopic for the main topic. Abacaxi's main draw is that the videos are submitted and voted on by community members so that not only do users get a variety of content, they get content that community members of all knowledge levels think is appropriate and effective.

# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
