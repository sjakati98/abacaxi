# Project Description

Abacaxi is a web application designed to ease the process of finding additional materials, mainly video, 
through which interested parties may learn more about a specific topic. It pulls the exact page structure
from the Wikipedia Page corresponding to the topic, with application specific styles applied to it. Under
each heading, however, resides user submitted videos that relate to the respective topic. The main draw of 
Abacaxi is that videos are submitted by users themselves, and are subsequently voted on by users.

# Project Extension

The two separate project extensions we performed were the modularization of our application with Webpack, and the 
addition of a router. To complete the modularization, we moved both our pure stateless components and our
stateful components into separate files within a component folder. To use the router, we installed react-router
and utilized a Router component as a wrapper around our top level App component.
